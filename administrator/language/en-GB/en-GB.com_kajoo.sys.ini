COM_KAJOO_XML_DESCRIPTION="Kajoo is a set of extensions for the award-winning Joomla CMS which offers flexible interfaces to handle media assets stored on a Kaltura powered streaming server. Its primary focus lies in the content distribution industry. As such, it largely extends Kaltura's metadata tools in order to address very specific needs professionals in this industry are faced with. The whole sales cycle is covered, from gathering information about existing or prospected customers to rights management. It can also generate professional looking catalogues to deliver in exhibitions and other promotional events. The frontend view can be structured as intended and still keep a sleek, straightforward look and feel. Furthermore, it loads equally well on all major rendering engines and devices. "
